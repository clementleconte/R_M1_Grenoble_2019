# Lecture 1: plotting

## Before we start: Rstudio

- Interactive console
- Object explorer
- Script window
- Plot window

## Before we start: R

- concatenate: c()
- assign: <-
- vector, matrices: rbind(), cbind()
- matrix extraction: [ ]
- variable extraction: $
- data frames: mpg



## Why do we plot

> *Why do we want to plot data?*

- we are human beings -- we are pattern recognizers
- we can *see* things we are not able to grasp from data
- good to explore a dataset and look for regularities
- good to *convey a clear message*
- to have fun
- (to show your colleagues how nice your plot is)

## What do you see?

![](fig/SlopePlot_pourcentage.png)

- Plots allow to convey a lot of information in a compact way

## Good plots, bad plots

- It is important to make *good* plots
- i.e., plots that *look good*...
- ...and are *honest* to the data

- it is very easy to *hide* the message rather than *highlighting* it
- it is very easy to *mislead* with a plot
- so let's start with a gallery of **bad plots**. Can you guess *why* they are bad?

## Bad plotting 1

## The road to good plotting

- know your data
- think before you hit the enter button
- sketch on paper first
- be honest
- draw your axis first
- choose your visualization wisely

## Some data

We will start by using the *built-in dataset* **mpg**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mpg
```


## A look at the data

- *model* : model name
- *displ* : engine displacement, in litres
- *year* : year of manufacture
- *cyl* : number of cylinders
- *trans* : type of transmission
- *drv* : f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
- *cty* : city miles per gallon
- *hwy* : highway miles per gallon
- *fl* : fuel type
- *class* : "type" of car




## We will be using `ggplot2`. Why?

Advantages of ggplot2

-   consistent underlying `grammar of graphics` (Wilkinson, 2005)
-   plot specification at a high level of abstraction
-   very flexible
-   theme system for polishing plot appearance
-   mature and complete graphics system
-   many users, active mailing list

## What is a grammar of graphics?

The basic idea: independently specify plot building blocks and combine them to create just about any kind of graphical display you want. Building blocks of a graph include:

-   data
-   aesthetic mapping
-   geometric object
-   statistical transformations
-   scales
-   coordinate system
-   position adjustments
-   faceting

## Starting from the basics

**As in a grammar the minimal sentence is a subject in a plot the minimal object is data **

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(mpg)
```

**In a grammar, you need a verb. In plots, this is axis**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

### Still no plot generated!


## Generating a plot

**But you also need an object. In ggplot, this is *geoms* **
```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_point()
```

## Generating a plot, 2

**But you also need an object. In ggplot, this is *geoms* **
```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_smooth()
```


## Generating a plot, 3

**But you also need an object. In ggplot, this is *geoms* **
```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_smooth()+geom_point()
```


## The beauty of a grammar metaphor

- once you get the main idea, adding things is easy
- a plot is a sentence made with data
- you add layers with `+`
- as you would add words to a sentence
- as in grammar you use adjectives to give more nuanced meaning, in plots you could use `+` to add color, fill, size, shape, etc...

## Adding meaning: color

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(color=class))
```

## Adding meaning: size

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(size=cyl))
```


## Adding meaning: color AND size

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(size = cyl, color=class))
```

## Adding meaning: shape

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(shape=fl))
```




## Adding meaning: all together

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(color=manufacturer, shape =fl, size = cyl))

```


## Facets

- sometimes sentences become a bit too long
- it is useful to split them up in shorter sentences
- for instance, you could first talk about a car, *then* another one
- in plots, you can split up the plot along a variable
- so that one plot is drawn for each level of a given variable, say type of fuel

## Facets

```{r, echo=TRUE}
p + geom_point(aes(color=manufacturer, size = cyl))+facet_grid(.~fl)
```



## More details on the grammar

A ggplot is made up of

- data (subject)
- axis (verb)
- geoms (object)
- aesthetic layers (size, fill color, shape, label, ...)
- facets (splitting sentences)

And then you can change how things look and behave:
- coordinate functions (changing the axis appearance and type)
- scale functions (changing the appearance of the geoms)
- theme functions (changing the appearance of the plot itself)


## Exploring data with plots: one variable

*Plot types depend on the variable type*


- *one-variable plots, discrete variable*: barplot
- *one-variable plots, continuous variable*: distribution, density

## Barplots
- let's look at the drive type of the cars: front, rear, or 4wd

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(drv))
p + geom_bar()
```


## Barplots

- not so fancy. should we add color?

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(drv))
p + geom_bar(aes(color=drv))
```

## Barplots

- ups. Maybe we meant fill?

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(drv))
p + geom_bar(aes(fill=drv))
```


## Barplots

- nice. doesn't add much information, though. what if we cross it with car class?

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(drv))
p + geom_bar(aes(fill=class))
```


## Barplots

- By default stacked. How to unstack?

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(drv))
p + geom_bar(aes(fill=class), position = position_dodge())
```

## Barplots

- By default stacked. How to show relative weight?

```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(drv))
p + geom_bar(aes(fill=class), position = position_fill())
```


## One variable, continuous: mpg on highway

* When the variable is continuous, it makes more sense to show distributions
```{r}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy))
p + geom_histogram()
```

## Histograms: binwidth

```{r}
p + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

## Histograms: binwidth

```{r}
p + geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```

## An alternative do histogram: dotplot
```{r}
p + geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.5)
```

## Continuous distribution: Kernel Density Estimation

```{r}
p + geom_density()
```

## Continuous distribution: Kernel Density Estimation

```{r}
p + geom_density(adjust = 3)
```

## Continuous distribution: Kernel Density Estimation

```{r}
p + geom_density(adjust = 0.5)
```
